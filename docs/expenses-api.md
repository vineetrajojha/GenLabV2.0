# Expenses API (Beginner Friendly Guide)

Use this guide when you work on the mobile app. It keeps things simple and lists only the pieces you really need.

## 1. Quick Start

1. **Login and grab a JWT token** using the existing auth API (ask the backend team if you do not have it yet).
2. **Add the header** on every request:
   - `Authorization: Bearer <your-token>`
3. **Pick the right base URL**, for example: `https://your-server.example.com/api` (replace with the real host).
4. **Use the endpoints below**. The request and response bodies are plain JSON unless a file upload is mentioned.

## 2. Vocabulary (keep handy)

- `section` tells you what type of expense you deal with: `marketing`, `office`, or `personal`.
- `status` shows progress: `pending`, `approved`, or `rejected`. Use `all` when searching.
- `marketing_person_code` is usually the staff code. When the app does not send it (office/personal sections), the server creates one automatically.
- Personal expenses can be grouped by month when they are sent for approval. The API calls those grouped rows "summaries".

## 3. Data Cheat Sheet

Every expense item in the responses has these main fields:

| Field | What it means |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique expense id |
| `section` | `marketing`, `office`, or `personal` |
| `person_name` | Display name shown in the portal |
| `marketing_person_code` | Code for the staff member (auto-generated if missing) |
| `amount` | Submitted amount |
| `approved_amount` | Amount approved so far |
| `due_amount` | `amount - approved_amount` |
| `status` | `pending`, `approved`, or `rejected` |
| `from_date` / `to_date` | Date range covered by the entry |
| `receipt_url` | Download link if a receipt file exists |
| `approval_summary_url` | PDF link when personal expenses get grouped |
| `aggregate_ids` | Only for grouped personal rows: ids of the child expenses |


## 4. User App Endpoints (guard: `multi_jwt:api`)


### 4.1 List expenses

```
GET /api/expenses
```

Query helpers (all optional):

| Query | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `section` | `marketing` | default is `marketing` |
| `status` | `pending` | use `all` for every status |
| `month` / `year` | `11` / `2025` | filters by created date |
| `search` | `john` | matches person name or staff code |
| `group_personal` | `0` | only for personal section; `1` (default) groups rows |
| `per_page` | `10` | override pagination size |

Example:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  "https://your-server.example.com/api/expenses?section=personal&month=11&year=2025"
```

Sample success (trimmed):

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "section": "personal",
      "person_name": "John Doe",
      "amount": 200.5,
      "approved_amount": 0,
      "due_amount": 200.5,
      "status": "pending",
      "aggregate_ids": [40, 41],
      "personal_period_label": "Nov 2025",
      "receipt_urls": ["https://your-server.example.com/storage/...pdf"]
    }
  ],
  "links": { ... pagination ... },
  "meta": { ... pagination ... },
  "totals": {
    "total_expenses": 200.5,
    "approved": 0,
    "due": 200.5
  },
  "filters": {
    "section": "personal",
    "status": "all",
    "group_personal": true
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Create an expense

```
POST /api/expenses
```

Send `multipart/form-data` if you attach a receipt (`pdf`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, max 20 MB). Otherwise JSON works.

Body fields:

- `section` (optional, default `marketing`)
- `marketing_person_code` or `marketing_person_name`
- `amount` (required)
- `from_date`, `to_date` (required, `to_date` must be >= `from_date`)
- `description` (optional)
- `pdf` (optional file)

Response: 201 Created with the new expense JSON.

### 4.3 See a single expense

```
GET /api/expenses/{expenseId}
```

Returns one expense, including relations (`marketing_person`, `approver` if available).

### 4.4 Update a personal expense

```
PUT /api/expenses/{expenseId}
```

Rules:

- Only works for `section = personal`.
- Entry must still be `pending`.
- Same validation as creation. Receipt file can be replaced.

### 4.5 Delete a personal expense

```
DELETE /api/expenses/{expenseId}
```

Only for pending personal expenses. Existing receipt files are removed automatically.

### 4.6 Send personal expenses for approval

```
POST /api/expenses/personal/send-for-approval
```

Body (JSON or form-data):

- `month` (optional, default current month)
- `year` (optional, default current year)

What happens:

1. Finds all pending personal expenses created in that month.
2. Flags them as submitted.
3. Generates a PDF summary under `storage/app/public/marketing_expenses`.
4. Returns the summary URL and a grouped JSON row you can show to the user.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "summary_path": "marketing_expenses/personal-expenses-2025_11-abc123.pdf",
  "download_url": "https://your-server.example.com/storage/marketing_expenses/personal-expenses-2025_11-abc123.pdf",
  "summary": { ... grouped expense ... },
  "pending_count": 12
}
```

## 5. Admin App Endpoints (guard: `multi_jwt:api_admin`)

Use these if the admin section inside the app needs to review requests.

### 5.1 List expenses for review

```
GET /api/admin/expenses
```

Same query options as the user list endpoint. When `section=personal` and `status=pending`, the response contains grouped rows ready for approval.

### 5.2 Show a specific expense (or summary)

```
GET /api/admin/expenses/{expenseId}
```

If the id belongs to a grouped summary, the response still includes `aggregate_ids` so you can display the underlying items.

### 5.3 Approve

```
POST /api/admin/expenses/{expenseId}/approve
```

Body (JSON):

- `approved_amount` (required) — amount to approve across the target expense(s)
- `approval_note` (optional text)
- `group_ids` (optional array) — send this when approving multiple personal items together

The API automatically spreads the approved amount across the grouped expenses until there is no pending amount left.

Success response includes updated totals and the refreshed summary JSON.

### 5.4 Reject

```
POST /api/admin/expenses/{expenseId}/reject
```

Body: same as approve but without `approved_amount`. All selected items become `rejected`.

## 6. Error Cheatsheet

- **401 Unauthorized**: token missing or expired. Login again.
- **403 Forbidden**: trying to edit a section you are not allowed to change (for example editing a marketing expense through the personal endpoint).
- **422 Validation error**: payload is incomplete. The response contains an `errors` object telling you what to fix.

Example 422:

```json
{
  "message": "The given data was invalid.",
  "errors": {
    "amount": ["The amount field is required."]
  }
}
```

## 7. Handy Developer Notes

- Routes live in `routes/api.php`.
- Main controller: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/ExpenseApiController.php`.
- JSON formatter: `app/Http/Resources/MarketingExpenseResource.php`.
- Shared helpers: `app/Traits/HandlesMarketingExpenses.php`.
- Receipts and PDF summaries are stored on the `public` disk (`php artisan storage:link` must be set up for public URLs).
- Quick route check: `php artisan route:list --path=expenses`.
